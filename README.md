1. **Project Title**
ASL Sign Language Detection

2. **Introduction**
Build an ANN model to recognize ASL hand gestures and convert them to text.
Focus on the ASL alphabet (excluding 'J' and 'Z' due to motion requirements).
Aims to improve accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

3. **Key Features**
Deep Learning: Utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
Image Dataset: Preprocessed and cleaned ASL hand gesture images.
Evaluation: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Data Augmentation: Applied to improve model performance.
